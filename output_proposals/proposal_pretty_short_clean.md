c) Accessibility (Section 508/WCAG 2.2 AA) Checklist highlights (Power BI dashboards, web/UI, PDFs)

• Perceivable: Alt text for visuals; color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text) and ≥ 3:1 (large text, UI); captions/transcripts for media; reflow at 320 CSS px.
• Operable: Full keyboard access; logical tab order; visible focus with ≥ 3:1 contrast; pointer gestures have alternatives; target size ≥ 24px or provide alternative.
• Understandable: Clear labels/instructions; consistent help; accessible authentication; meaningful error messages; plain language.
• Robust: Valid HTML/ARIA; name/role/value exposed; correct focus management; screen reader support (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver).
• Tools/methods: ANDI, axe, Accessibility Insights, WAVE, PAC 2024, Power BI Accessibility Checker; manual SR tests; zoom/reflow.
• Remediation SLAs: Blocker ≤ 5 business days; High ≤ 10–15 business days; Medium ≤ 20–30 days; Low ≤ 60–90 days with regression verification.

Declaration of Conformance (DoD snippet) We commit that dashboards, web UI, and PDFs delivered under this contract will conform to Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 AA. Conformance will be
validated with DHS Trusted Tester-aligned methods using automated tools (e.g., ANDI, axe, PAC 2024) and manual testing (keyboard-only and screen readers such as NVDA/JAWS).
Nonconformances will be remediated per stated SLAs prior to acceptance with verified retesting. We will produce and maintain an Accessibility Conformance Report (VPAT/ACR) for City
review.

d) SCRM & SBOM SOP (Executive Summary + SOP excerpt) Executive Summary We manage software supply chain risk with vetted suppliers, continuous dependency scanning, signed SBOMs
(CycloneDX/SPDX), tamper-evident builds, and artifact signing. All third-party SaaS undergoes FedRAMP Moderate-aligned assessment; we require Section 889 and Kaspersky attestations.
Confirmed security incidents trigger 2-hour notification to the City CISO. All data and artifacts remain US-resident (Azure Government). This posture accelerates audits, reduces
vulnerability exposure, and ensures transparency.

Key SOP points (full SOP provided in Appendix C):

• Supplier vetting: FedRAMP Moderate preferred; Section 889/Kaspersky attestations; US-only residency; VPAT for user-facing SaaS.
• Dependency scanning: SCA for every PR and nightly; lockfiles; secrets scans; base image scanning.
• SBOM: Generate CycloneDX 1.5 and SPDX 2.3 for each build; sign with Cosign; store immutably; deliver to City within 5 business days post-release; monthly deltas.
• Vulnerability SLAs: Critical ≤ 72h; High ≤ 7d; Medium ≤ 30d; Low ≤ 90d; hotfix for exploited-in-the-wild within 48h.
• Tamper-evident builds: Signed artifacts and SLSA-style provenance; verify signatures prior to deploy.
• Incident communications: 2-hour notification to City CISO for confirmed incidents; daily updates until closure.
• Toggles: Municipal data only; US-only residency; no CJIS/ITAR unless authorized; Azure Gov/FedRAMP alignment.

e) Compliance Red Team Findings and Fix Integration High-severity items (addressed in draft):
