┃  1 Executive summary Springfield’s Department of Innovation & Technology (DoIT) powers mobility for residents—riders who rely on paratransit and microtransit, drivers and dispatchers who ┃
┃    keep streets safe, and analysts who direct resources during storms and events. Our modernization approach upgrades Mobility Services from legacy, siloed tools to a secure, cloud-first ┃
┃    platform that shortens trip scheduling times, reduces outages, and gives City leaders real-time visibility into performance.                                                            ┃

┃ We propose a four-task delivery: T-1 Assessment and roadmap, T-2 Cloud migration and integration, T-3 Analytics and dashboards, and T-4 Change management and support. The solution runs   ┃
┃ in Azure Government aligned to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate [IT-1], delivers role-based dashboards through Microsoft 365 and Power BI [IT-2],  ┃
┃ and standardizes integrations via Representational State Transfer (REST)/JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) documented in OpenAPI 3.1 [IT-3].     ┃
┃ Security is designed to National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST SP) 800-53 Moderate [S-1] with citywide multi-factor authentication (MFA) [S-2] and a     ┃
┃ two-hour incident reporting commitment to the City Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) [S-3]. Privacy practices follow the Privacy Act and Springfield ordinances [C-3].             ┃
┃ Accessibility meets ADA and Section 508 with conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA [C-2]. Our staffing plan includes a program manager, cloud engineer, data   ┃
┃ analyst, and user experience (UX) writer [P-1], with letters of availability [P-2] and background checks/badging [P-3].                                                                    ┃

┃ Phase 1 completion by December 31, 2025 [D-4]; and D-5 final acceptance by August 31, 2026 [D-5]. By project close, DoIT will see 25–35% faster dispatch processing, 99.9% service         ┃
┃ availability, and transparent performance reporting for residents and council—while meeting all Request for Proposals (RFP) requirements [C-1]. This foundation also enables phased        ┃

┃  2 Understanding Springfield’s mission Springfield’s Mobility Services connects people to jobs, school, health care, and civic life. Today, dispatchers juggle phone calls, spreadsheets,  ┃
┃    and separate systems; riders wait on hold for updates; and managers lack a single, trusted view of on-time performance. Our proposal answers that reality with pragmatic modernization  ┃
┃    that keeps operations moving while improving the daily experience for residents and front-line City staff.                                                                              ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ We understand the City requires a turnkey approach that respects municipal constraints, protects sensitive data, and delivers measurable outcomes per the RFP scope [C-1]. The goals are   ┃
┃ clear: improve reliability; provide accessible digital experiences [C-2]; protect privacy in accordance with the Privacy Act and City ordinances [C-3]; and reduce technical debt while    ┃
┃ enabling interdepartmental data sharing. Our plan has worked in peer cities facing similar budget, infrastructure, and labor realities, and it is sequenced to minimize disruption to      ┃
┃ ongoing services such as snow response, street closures, and paratransit operations.                                                                                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ By aligning process, people, and technology, the City will gain a resilient platform to handle peak demand—when a thunderstorm hits, a festival closes streets, or a school year begins.   ┃
┃ The following sections explain how we deliver these outcomes and how we will manage risk so Springfield sees improvements within the first 30 days.                                        ┃

┃ T-1 Assessment and roadmap We begin by meeting Springfield dispatchers, fleet supervisors, accessibility advocates, and DoIT engineers to map current-state workflows. During discovery,   ┃
┃ the program manager leads workshops; the cloud engineer inventories applications and integrations; the data analyst profiles data quality; and the UX writer observes rider and staff      ┃
┃ interactions to capture plain-language needs. We document as-is and to-be processes, a security baseline aligned to NIST SP 800-53 Moderate [S-1], accessibility gaps against WCAG 2.2 AA  ┃
┃ [C-2], and privacy touchpoints consistent with the Privacy Act and City ordinances [C-3].                                                                                                  ┃

┃    data analyst, and UX writer—stay embedded with DoIT, meeting dispatchers on the floor and joining ride-alongs when appropriate to understand real-world constraints [P-1].              ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Roles and cadence are clear. The program manager owns scope, schedule, and risk, and chairs weekly stand-ups, biweekly demos, and monthly steering with Mobility leadership. The cloud     ┃
┃ engineer builds the Azure Government landing zone, APIs, security baselines, and CI/CD. The data analyst designs the data model, KPIs, and Power BI assets. The UX writer ensures plain    ┃
┃ language, accessibility, and task flows residents and staff can follow. We commit to 100% role coverage, a four-hour response window for critical issues during business hours, and        ┃
┃ on-call support during cutovers.                                                                                                                                                           ┃

┃ Per staffing requirements, we include signed letters of availability for each named role indicating minimum allocation for the project term and authorization to work on City systems      ┃
┃ [P-2]. Each staff member will complete required background checks and City badging before system access [P-3]. As a continuity safeguard, our contract names qualified alternates and a    ┃
┃ 10-business-day backfill SLA.                                                                                                                                                              ┃

┃  5 Security and privacy Residents trust Springfield with sensitive mobility information—pickup locations, disability accommodations, and payment details. We honor that trust by designing ┃
┃    security and privacy in from day one. Our controls align to NIST SP 800-53 Moderate [S-1], enforced in Azure Government’s FedRAMP Moderate environment [IT-1]. We implement             ┃
┃    least-privilege access (AC-2), strong authentication with MFA (IA-2) [S-2], continuous monitoring (CA-7), configuration management (CM-2), encryption in transit and at rest            ┃
┃    (SC-13/SC-12), logging and audit (AU-2/AU-12), and incident response (IR-4/IR-6).                                                                                                       ┃

┃ Identity and access are centralized in Microsoft Entra ID Government with conditional access and MFA for staff and administrators [S-2]. All APIs require Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0   ┃
┃ client credentials with per-scope tokens, and secrets are held in Azure Key Vault. Logs stream to the City’s SIEM for correlation and alerting; high-severity alerts page the on-call      ┃
┃ engineer and the program manager. In the event of a suspected or confirmed incident, we notify the City CISO within two hours with known facts, scope, and immediate containment steps     ┃
┃ [S-3]. A full incident report follows within five business days, including root cause and corrective actions.                                                                              ┃

┃ Privacy-by-design practices include data minimization, purpose limitation, and role-based masking of personally identifiable information (PII). We conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment     ┃
┃ (PIA), maintain a record of processing activities (ROPA), and ensure consent and notice in plain language per the Privacy Act and Springfield ordinances [C-3]. Data retention is          ┃
┃ policy-driven with automatic purging where allowed; exports are watermarked and audited. Our approach inherits Azure Government’s FedRAMP controls [IT-1] and extends them with            ┃
┃ City-specific standards.                                                                                                                                                                   ┃

┃  6 Technology architecture and integration We deploy an Azure Government landing zone with management groups, policy guardrails, and segregated hubs for development, test, and production ┃
┃    [IT-1]. Network traffic flows through Azure Firewall and Private Endpoints; secrets live in Azure Key Vault; and monitoring is consolidated in Azure Monitor and the City SIEM.         ┃
┃    Identity is managed through Microsoft Entra ID Government with single sign-on (SSO) and MFA [S-2].                                                                                      ┃

┃ Integrations move to REST/JSON services fronted by Azure API Management with per-API throttles and standardized error models. Each service is documented in OpenAPI 3.1 with schema        ┃
┃ examples and test collections to accelerate partner onboarding [IT-3]. Data pipelines orchestrated by Azure Data Factory land in Azure SQL Database (Government) and Azure Data Lake       ┃
┃ Storage Gen2 for analytics. CI/CD uses Git-based workflows with automated security scans and infrastructure as code. We target 99.9% uptime for critical services, median API latency      ┃
┃ under 200 ms, and a sub-30-minute recovery time objective (RTO) for analytic workloads.                                                                                                    ┃

┃  7 Accessibility and user experience Mobility systems must work for every Springfield resident. Our UX approach starts with inclusive research—observing how riders who use screen readers ┃
┃    book trips, how drivers navigate mobile user interfaces with gloves, and how dispatchers tab quickly across forms. We design and test to ADA and Section 508 with WCAG 2.2 AA criteria  ┃
┃    [C-2], so essential tasks are keyboard-operable, contrast exceeds 4.5:1, focus states are visible, error messages are clear, and time-sensitive interactions have alternatives.         ┃

┃ Executive summary (approx. 275 words) Our municipal Azure Government SaaS offering operates within a FedRAMP Moderate boundary and adheres to NIST SP 800-53 and the Privacy Act. We       ┃
┃ implement a comprehensive Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) program covering first- and third-party code, containers, CI/CD tooling, and COTS      ┃
┃ integrations. For every build and release, we generate signed SBOMs (SPDX and CycloneDX), store them in an Azure Government artifact repository, and enforce automated review gates tied   ┃
┃ to CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) and CVSS thresholds. We run SCA/SAST/DAST/Container scanning on a defined cadence, integrate findings into change control and a POA&M, and   ┃
┃ report metrics monthly to the AO/ISSO. Our third‑party intake evaluates vendors for FedRAMP authorization, Section 889 compliance, and Kaspersky non‑use, with one‑business‑day escalation ┃
┃ to the CO/COR and network/security operations centers for covered telecom issues. Exceptions require risk acceptance and time‑bound remediation. This SOP provides clear roles, workflows, ┃
┃ artifacts, and toggles for open-source, proprietary, and COTS to maintain secure, traceable supply chains while meeting municipal and federal requirements.                                ┃
