┃  2 Program Understanding & Outcomes ICE Fleet H.O.M.E. must unify fleet visibility, maintenance scheduling, asset lifecycle management, and compliance reporting so agents, dispatchers,   ┃
┃    and program managers can act quickly and confidently. The mission demands accuracy and availability: if a vehicle is down or a maintenance window is missed, operations slow and risk   ┃
┃    increases. Our approach connects asset telemetry, work orders, and vendor activity in one secure, role‑based experience that reduces paper processes and provides the audit             ┃
┃    traceability the program requires.                                                                                                                                                      ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Working with ICE stakeholders, the product team will translate requirements into human‑centered features, including simplified dispatch boards, proactive maintenance alerts, automated    ┃
┃ compliance checks, and one‑click reporting aligned to DHS and federal mandates. By streamlining intake and approvals, we target a reduction in work‑order cycle time of at least 25%       ┃
┃ within the first two release increments and a 15% improvement in fleet utilization by surfacing underused assets and optimizing routing. Baselines and measurement methods will be         ┃
┃ established during transition‑in and reviewed in governance.                                                                                                                               ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Delivery follows a steady cadence: discovery workshops in the first three weeks of transition‑in, biweekly backlog grooming with Government Product Owner participation, and monthly       ┃
┃ demonstrations tied to solicitation outcomes. Technical writers and data analysts will produce required deliverables—privacy documentation, ATO evidence, accessibility reports, and       ┃
┃ training materials—on schedule. In a comparable federal fleet initiative, this cadence reduced rework by 30% and accelerated the Authority to Operate (ATO) by two months through early    ┃
┃ alignment on security and data flows.                                                                                                                                                      ┃

┃  3 Technical Architecture & Hosting Options The architecture is modular and API‑driven. It operates in FedRAMP Authorized cloud environments or on Government Furnished Equipment,         ┃
┃    providing flexibility without compromising security. Deployed at scale, users experience fast, reliable access across field locations while program administrators retain control over  ┃
┃    data residency, boundary protections, and scaling.                                                                                                                                      ┃

┃ Core components include a web application on a Java LTS runtime (e.g., Java 17 or 21); a service mesh with mutual TLS using FIPS 140‑3 validated cryptographic modules; an event bus for   ┃
┃ telemetry ingestion; and a PostgreSQL‑compatible relational database with native encryption at rest. Containerized microservices run in a hardened Kubernetes cluster within a FedRAMP     ┃
┃ Moderate or High environment, depending on program need, with network segmentation and zero trust access enforced by policy‑as‑code. Client and server configurations follow Center for    ┃
┃ Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, and secrets are managed in a hardware‑backed key management service with rotation policies aligned to DHS 4300A.                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Deployment options will be selected during transition‑in, with documented tradeoffs for performance, ATO alignment, and cost. Regardless of hosting, we maintain a single code line and    ┃
┃ standardized infrastructure‑as‑code templates for consistent, repeatable environments. We support blue/green and canary deployments to minimize downtime, with automated rollbacks if      ┃
┃ health checks degrade. For connectivity and data sharing, we expose standards‑based REST/JSON and event‑driven APIs documented with OpenAPI, enforce rate limiting, and sign requests      ┃
┃ using FIPS 140‑3 validated libraries. Hosting options include FedRAMP Moderate/High cloud, hybrid with GFE data services, or on‑premises in a government enclave; in all cases, data       ┃
┃ residency is U.S.‑only and security controls remain constant.                                                                                                                              ┃

┃  4 Security & Compliance Framework Security is integrated across the lifecycle. The solution aligns with DHS 4300A, NIST SP 800‑53 Rev. 5 control families, and federal zero trust         ┃
┃    architecture guidance. We use FIPS 140‑3 validated cryptographic modules for data in transit and at rest, enforce TLS 1.2+ across services, and apply boundary protections through web  ┃
┃    application firewalls and API gateways. Access control combines role‑based and attribute‑based policies consistent with NIST SP 800‑53 AC and IA controls. Privileged access is managed ┃
┃    through just‑in‑time elevation and MFA with PIV/CAC support.                                                                                                                            ┃

┃ We maintain compliance with NIST SP 800‑171 for CUI, including marking, access restrictions, and secure collaboration, and provide evidence packages suitable for ICE ATO processes.       ┃
┃ Supply chain risk management aligns with Executive Order 14028 and FAR 52.204‑24/25/26, with explicit exclusion of prohibited telecommunications equipment and services under Section 889  ┃
┃ and a prohibition on Kaspersky products, consistent with federal directives. The runtime stack adheres to supported Java LTS releases; dependency updates are tracked with SBOMs and       ┃
┃ enforced via automated policy.                                                                                                                                                             ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Incident response follows DHS timelines: notify within one hour of detecting a suspected incident, provide rolling updates every four hours until containment, and submit a final report   ┃
┃ within required timeframes. Continuous monitoring includes automated control evidence, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing aligned with DHS and FedRAMP requirements. Logging  ┃
┃ meets OMB M‑21‑31 event logging guidance; we retain at least 12 months of searchable logs and 24 months total, protect audit records against tampering, and review them daily in our SOC.  ┃
┃ In a recent federal case management program, this framework supported an ATO with no high or critical findings from penetration testing and sustained 99.98% monthly availability while    ┃
┃ meeting all POA&M closure deadlines.                                                                                                                                                       ┃

┃ We implement data minimization and purpose limitation at ingestion and apply field‑level encryption to sensitive attributes. U.S.‑only data residency is enforced through account‑level    ┃
┃ policies and network restrictions. We prepare Privacy Impact Assessment inputs and System of Records Notice support materials, as applicable, in coordination with the ICE Privacy Office, ┃
┃ and we maintain a living data inventory and data flow diagrams as part of ATO evidence. Access decisions are enforced by attribute‑based controls tied to role, clearance, and             ┃
┃ need‑to‑know, with consistent marking and labeling for CUI.                                                                                                                                ┃

┃ Data retention schedules are configurable to match ICE records schedules, and secure disposal follows NIST SP 800‑88. We provide export capabilities in open formats with chain‑of‑custody ┃
┃ logging for oversight and legal review. For external data sharing, we require written approval and a data‑sharing agreement; data is de‑identified or aggregated where feasible, and       ┃
┃ sharing is logged and reviewed in governance. In a prior federal fleet analytics project, similar controls enabled cross‑program reporting without exposing PII and reduced manual         ┃
┃ redactions by 70% through automated data masking.                                                                                                                                          ┃

┃  6 Accessibility & Usability Operators—dispatchers, mechanics, and program analysts—must be able to use the platform effectively. We design for accessibility from the outset so users     ┃
┃    complete tasks quickly and accurately, reducing training overhead and support calls.                                                                                                    ┃

┃ The UX team follows Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.1 AA criteria, validating conformance through the DHS Section 508 Trusted Tester process. We will deliver an up‑to‑date Accessibility ┃
┃ Conformance Report (VPAT/ACR) at each major release and remediate any nonconformance on documented timelines. Keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast, ARIA roles, and form labeling are  ┃

┃    frequent, predictable, and low risk for mission users.                                                                                                                                  ┃

┃ We employ CI/CD with signed commits, branch protection, and reproducible builds. Dependency and container scanning run on every merge. Static application security testing, software       ┃
┃ composition analysis, and infrastructure‑as‑code policy checks must pass before promotion. We maintain SBOMs in CycloneDX or SPDX format and publish them with every production release    ┃
┃ and at least monthly; we notify the Government within 24 hours of a material SBOM change involving a critical component. The runtime stack is anchored on Java LTS to ensure patch         ┃
┃ availability and long‑term stability.                                                                                                                                                      ┃

┃ Vulnerability management follows federal timelines: critical and high‑severity findings are mitigated or patched within 15 calendar days, medium within 30 days, and low within 90 days,   ┃
┃ or as otherwise directed by DHS. We align with applicable CISA Binding Operational Directives for known exploited vulnerabilities and remediate within mandated windows. Exploitability    ┃
┃ and asset criticality inform risk acceptance, which requires documented Government concurrence. In a public safety records system, this approach cut mean time to remediate critical       ┃
┃ vulnerabilities by 57% and eliminated configuration drift through immutable infrastructure.                                                                                                ┃

┃  8 Service Levels, Monitoring, and Reporting Cadence We commit to 99.9% monthly uptime for the application tier (excluding approved maintenance windows). Incident severities have clear   ┃
┃    response targets: Priority‑1 incidents are acknowledged within 15 minutes with restoration work underway within 30 minutes; restoration targets by severity and component will be       ┃
┃    baselined during transition‑in and codified in the SLA. Synthetic and real‑user monitoring feed dashboards visible to Government stakeholders, and logs are correlated in a centralized ┃
┃    SIEM with automated anomaly detection.                                                                                                                                                  ┃

┃ We provide weekly operational summaries, monthly service reviews, and quarterly executive briefs that tie system health to mission outcomes—availability, latency, error rates, and user   ┃
┃ adoption. Reports also cover compliance status, POA&M progress, and SBOM updates.                                                                                                          ┃

┃   9 Training, Change Management, and Adoption We deliver blended training through live virtual sessions, microlearning videos, searchable knowledge base articles, and in‑application      ┃
┃     guidance. New users complete required training within 30 days of account provisioning, with annual refresher training aligned to DHS policy and role changes. We track completion and  ┃
┃     proficiency by role so supervisors can identify who needs targeted support. Release communications explain what is changing, why it matters, and how to get help. We conduct           ┃
┃     early‑access previews for super users to gather feedback before each deployment. Adoption is measured with KPIs such as first‑week task completion rate, time‑to‑first‑success, and    ┃
┃     help desk ticket volume.                                                                                                                                                               ┃
┃  10 Incident Response and Continuity (DR/BCP) We operate a 24x7 incident response process integrated with Government escalation paths. Initial notification occurs within one hour of      ┃
┃     detection of a suspected incident, followed by four‑hour status updates and a final incident report within required timeframes that includes root cause and corrective actions.        ┃
┃     Playbooks cover security, availability, and data integrity events and are exercised at least twice per year with joint participation.                                                  ┃

┃  11 Transition‑In and Transition‑Out Transition‑in spans 90 days, starting with a kickoff to confirm scope, hosting choice, and security boundary. Weeks 1–3 cover discovery, environment  ┃
┃     provisioning, and access approvals; weeks 4–8 focus on data migration planning, initial integrations, and baseline security scans; weeks 9–12 culminate in a pilot release, training,  ┃
┃     and readiness reviews. We deliver initial ATO evidence, the first VPAT/ACR, privacy documentation inputs, and the initial SBOM during this window. Data migration follows a validated  ┃
