┃  1 Executive Summary Springfield’s Department of Information Technology (DoIT) has a clear mission: make it easier for residents, visitors, and businesses to move through the city safely ┃
┃    and reliably. Modernizing Mobility Services—parking, permits, curb management, micro-mobility integrations, field crew tools, and public-facing information—will simplify daily life    ┃
┃    for families getting to school, operators managing events downtown, and crews responding to storms. When this approach succeeds, residents will notice shorter wait times, clearer      ┃
┃    options, and accessible digital services that work the first time, every time.                                                                                                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Our solution delivers a secure, accessible, and scalable mobility platform hosted in Azure Government and aligned to FedRAMP Moderate, with APIs designed OpenAPI-first and data           ┃
┃ visualized in Power BI for real-time operational decisions. The approach satisfies Springfield’s commercial-item acquisition strategy under FAR Part 12 [C-01], enforces multi-factor      ┃
┃ authentication for all privileged and end-user access [SEC-02], and meets a two-hour incident notification window to the City’s CISO and DoIT security leadership [SEC-03]. We build to    ┃
┃ NIST SP 800-53 Moderate controls [SEC-01], and all public experiences conform to Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 AA [A11Y-01]. The platform uses Azure Government services and FedRAMP Moderate   ┃
┃ SaaS to meet the City’s hosting and security expectations [IT-01], leverages Microsoft 365 and Power BI for collaboration and insight [IT-02], and exposes REST/JSON APIs defined by       ┃
┃ OpenAPI to streamline partner integration [IT-03].                                                                                                                                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ We will deliver in phases to minimize risk and accelerate value. Key dates include Project Kickoff on September 2, 2025 [D-03], Phase 1 completion by December 31, 2025 [D-04], and Final  ┃
┃ Acceptance by August 31, 2026 [D-05]. By the end of Phase 1, residents will see faster permit processing and clearer curb regulations; field crews will reduce time from dispatch to       ┃
┃ onsite validation, measured through operational dashboards in Power BI [IT-02]. Our OpenAPI-first pattern reduces onboarding time for new mobility partners compared with legacy           ┃
┃ point-to-point integrations [IT-03]. The program creates an extensible foundation so the City can add new mobility partners, support dynamic curb pricing, and integrate winter response   ┃
┃ routing with minimal rework—keeping digital services aligned to resident needs and policy goals.                                                                                           ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  2 Technical Approach (Tasks 1–4) Task 1 – Discover and Blueprint [T-01]. We begin with focused discovery led by a joint City–contractor team. Together we map current-state integrations, ┃
┃    document system dependencies, and capture resident and staff journeys. The team produces an OpenAPI backlog for priority interfaces, a data lineage map from source to dashboard, and   ┃
┃    measurable success metrics tied to outcomes such as time-to-permit and crew response times. The blueprint aligns to NIST SP 800-53 Moderate scoping [SEC-01], privacy requirements      ┃
┃    under the Privacy Act and Springfield ordinances [PRIV-01], and FAR Part 12 commercial practices [C-01]. In parallel, we stand up an Azure Government landing zone and baseline CI/CD   ┃
┃    in Azure DevOps [IT-01], and establish a two-week sprint cadence with City demonstrations and decision checkpoints.                                                                     ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Task 2 – Design and Build [T-02]. We implement an OpenAPI-first integration layer using Azure API Management, with REST/JSON endpoints defined, contract-tested, and versioned in Git      ┃
┃ under standard branch policies [IT-03]. Public-facing features are responsive and accessible, meeting Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 AA standards and validated with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver   ┃
┃ using keyboard-only workflows [A11Y-01]. For staff and administrative applications, Microsoft Entra Conditional Access enforces MFA and least-privilege access [SEC-02]. Each sprint       ┃
┃ delivers working increments that City staff can evaluate in demos. We instrument the platform to capture KPIs from the start—time-to-permit, curb space occupancy, and field response      ┃
┃ metrics—surfaced via curated Power BI dashboards [IT-02] so leaders and front-line teams can take timely action.                                                                           ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Task 3 – Migrate and Integrate [T-03]. We migrate priority datasets—permits, curb rules, device telemetry—into Azure SQL and Data Lake Storage Gen2 with encryption in transit and at rest ┃
┃ under Azure Government services [IT-01]. Legacy SOAP and CSV feeds are proxied through the API gateway and normalized into REST/JSON, using façade services to avoid disrupting current    ┃
┃ operations [IT-03]. At least two third-party providers will be onboarded using OpenAPI specifications to validate the pattern and accelerate subsequent partner integrations. Data         ┃
┃ retention and minimization align to the Privacy Act and Springfield ordinances [PRIV-01], with role-based access controls implemented consistent with NIST SP 800-53 Moderate [SEC-01]. We ┃
┃ coordinate closely with data owners to ensure continuity and quality during migration and cutover.                                                                                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Task 4 – Operate, Train, and Transition [T-04]. We establish runbooks, service-level targets, and a two-hour incident notification protocol to the City’s CISO and DoIT security           ┃
┃ leadership [SEC-03]. Operations leverage Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights to maintain a monthly composite availability target and measurable mean time to restore    ┃
┃ (MTTR) for P1 incidents. We train supervisors, 311 agents, and City analysts using Microsoft 365 (Teams, SharePoint) and Power BI-enabled playbooks [IT-02], and we support                ┃
┃ “train-the-trainer” sessions so the City can sustain adoption. By Final Acceptance, the City leads the release process, supported by documented knowledge transfer and staffing plans to   ┃
┃ ensure continuity after transition.                                                                                                                                                        ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  3 Security, Privacy, and Compliance Security is integrated into every stage. We align safeguards to NIST SP 800-53 Moderate control families and document applicability and inheritance   ┃
┃    from Azure Government and relevant SaaS providers [SEC-01]. The platform runs in Azure Government with FedRAMP Moderate baselines, including encryption at rest and in transit, network ┃
┃    segmentation, and key management through Azure Key Vault [IT-01]. Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all privileged roles and staff-facing apps via Entra Conditional Access   ┃
┃    and Privileged Identity Management [SEC-02]. We log administrative actions, retain security logs per City policy, and route alerts to the City’s SIEM for centralized monitoring.       ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Privacy is designed into the architecture. We minimize collection of personal data, implement role-based access to constrain who can see what, and enforce retention schedules in          ┃
┃ alignment with the Privacy Act and Springfield ordinances [PRIV-01]. Data flows are documented in the blueprint so the City can demonstrate compliance and answer resident questions       ┃
┃ confidently. Third-party processors and partners are required to maintain equivalent protections with appropriate FAR Part 12 flow-down clauses [C-01], and we review their API interfaces ┃
┃ for consistent security controls.                                                                                                                                                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Incident readiness is formalized. We commit to an initial two-hour notification to the City’s CISO and DoIT security leadership [SEC-03], followed by coordinated response activities and  ┃
┃ root-cause analysis. Our incident handling follows the NIST lifecycle, with playbooks that cover credential compromise, data exposure, DDoS scenarios, and vendor outages [SEC-01].        ┃
┃ Lessons learned feed back into backlog items and control improvements, ensuring continuous strengthening of the environment.                                                               ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  4 Data, Integration, and Architecture The architecture is service-oriented and resilient. We adopt an OpenAPI-first strategy to define and govern service interfaces, reducing            ┃
┃    integration friction for new partners [IT-03]. Azure API Management hosts the gateway and applies consistent policies—OAuth 2.0 for delegated access, throttling to protect upstream    ┃
┃    systems, and schema validation to maintain data quality. Legacy feeds are wrapped by façade services that normalize payloads and decouple modernization from ongoing operations,        ┃
┃    allowing teams to migrate at a sustainable pace.                                                                                                                                        ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Data lands in Azure Government within a hub-and-spoke model using Azure SQL for transactional workloads, Data Lake Storage Gen2 for scalable storage, and Data Factory for orchestrations. ┃
┃ Curated semantic models in Power BI expose trustworthy metrics for frontline supervisors and policy leaders [IT-02]. We maintain data catalogs and lineage artifacts to explain what data  ┃
┃ is used, where it comes from, and how it informs decisions. Governance is enforced from ingestion forward: access is role-based, datasets minimize personally identifiable information by  ┃
┃ default, and retention complies with the Privacy Act and local ordinances [PRIV-01]. Secrets and certificates are stored in Azure Key Vault and referenced by infrastructure as code,      ┃
┃ which reduces configuration drift and simplifies audits. The result is a platform with responsive endpoints, reliable operations, and analytics that drive service improvements.           ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  5 Project Management, Staffing, and Governance Delivery follows a pragmatic Agile model tailored to City governance. Two-week sprints culminate in demos for City stakeholders, followed  ┃
┃    by refinement and prioritization sessions. A monthly steering meeting reviews progress, risks, and upcoming decisions so leaders can remove roadblocks early. Azure DevOps manages      ┃
┃    backlogs, test plans, and releases; Teams and SharePoint organize collaboration and documentation; and Power BI reports track schedule variance, throughput, and defect trends [IT-02]. ┃
┃    This transparency keeps the focus on outcomes residents feel—faster services and clearer information.                                                                                   ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Change control aligns to the City’s procurement and oversight practices. Material scope or schedule changes flow through a change control board that includes the City’s Contracting       ┃
┃ Officer’s Representative to maintain FAR Part 12 alignment [C-01]. Access is granted on a least-privilege basis and reviewed quarterly consistent with NIST SP 800-53 Moderate [SEC-01],   ┃
┃ and all project staff complete annual privacy and security training under City policy [PRIV-01]. Key roles include a Program Manager, Solution Architect, Security Officer, Accessibility  ┃
┃ Lead, Product Owner, and subject-matter experts in data and integration. The team structure ensures Springfield has a single, accountable point of contact with the breadth of expertise   ┃
┃ to deliver securely and on schedule.                                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  6 Accessibility, UX, and Change Management Every resident interaction must be intuitive and accessible. All public-facing experiences meet Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 AA [A11Y-01]. We use  ┃
┃    semantic HTML, maintain keyboard-only navigation, provide visible focus states and sufficient contrast, and present clear, accessible error handling. These practices are verified with ┃
┃    common assistive technologies during development and validated again during user acceptance. Accessibility checks are built into code review and CI gates so regressions are caught     ┃
┃    before release.                                                                                                                                                                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ We pair strong UX with proactive change management. Short, task-focused videos delivered through Teams, printable job aids for field crews, and in-app prompts guide users at the moment   ┃
┃ of need [IT-02]. We enlist super-users in each department to serve as champions, offering hands-on help and gathering feedback that feeds sprint planning. This combination of support and ┃
┃ rapid iteration makes adoption quick and durable, reducing the time residents and staff spend navigating systems and increasing time spent solving real problems.                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  7 Testing, Deployment, and Operations Quality and reliability are engineered into the pipeline. We implement CI/CD in Azure DevOps with gated pipelines, automated unit and contract      ┃
┃    tests, and security scanning throughout. Test environments mirror production using infrastructure as code and policy enforcement, which reduces surprises at deployment. Before each    ┃
┃    major release, we run performance tests to confirm low median API latency and low error rates under expected loads. Accessibility verification is included in UAT so new features       ┃
┃    launch compliant and usable [A11Y-01].                                                                                                                                                  ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃ Operations emphasize observability and responsiveness. Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights provide end-to-end telemetry so the team can detect issues early and resolve ┃
┃ them quickly. SLAs include a two-hour initial incident notification to the City’s CISO and DoIT security leadership [SEC-03]. Backup and disaster recovery plans are aligned to            ┃
┃ City-defined recovery point and recovery time objectives and validated quarterly through tabletop and restore tests. Monthly patching cycles keep systems current, and vulnerabilities are ┃
┃ remediated within City-defined windows aligned to NIST guidance [SEC-01]. This discipline ensures continuity during peak periods—snowstorms, events, and school starts—when residents      ┃
┃ depend on accurate information and reliable services most.                                                                                                                                 ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                            ┃
┃   8 Deliverables and Milestones Deliverables align with commercial practices under FAR Part 12 [C-01], the documentation needs associated with NIST SP 800-53 Moderate [SEC-01], and the   ┃
┃     City’s privacy and accessibility commitments [PRIV-01, A11Y-01]. We maintain clear acceptance criteria and trace deliverables to outcomes so City reviewers can confirm readiness      ┃
┃     without ambiguity. Key dates include the Q&A Deadline on July 8, 2025 at 2:00 PM CT [D-01]; Proposal Due on July 22, 2025 at 4:00 PM CT [D-02]; Project Kickoff on September 2, 2025   ┃
┃     [D-03]; Phase 1 Completion on December 31, 2025 [D-04]; and Final Acceptance on August 31, 2026 [D-05]. These milestones anchor the work plan and provide predictable checkpoints to   ┃
┃     validate resident-facing value.                                                                                                                                                        ┃
┃   9 Risk Management We maintain a living risk register linked to user stories and dependencies so mitigation stays connected to day-to-day work. Priority risks include third-party API    ┃
┃     instability, privacy non-compliance, schedule compression around civic events, and accessibility regressions. Mitigations include circuit breakers and intelligent retries at the API  ┃
┃     gateway, data minimization and data loss prevention controls, freeze windows before critical events, and automated accessibility checks in CI [A11Y-01, PRIV-01]. We track risk        ┃
┃     trendlines and decisions in Power BI for visibility [IT-02]. Our goal is zero preventable P1 security incidents, supported by configuration controls aligned to NIST SP 800-53         ┃
┃     Moderate [SEC-01] and MFA enforcement for critical systems and administrative roles [SEC-02]. When incidents occur, we meet the two-hour notification standard and drive corrective    ┃
┃     actions through root-cause analysis [SEC-03].                                                                                                                                          ┃
┃  10 Past Performance Our team brings relevant municipal mobility and transportation experience that maps directly to Springfield’s needs. Prior projects include Azure Government hosting  ┃
┃     with FedRAMP Moderate inheritance [IT-01], OpenAPI-first design patterns for curb and parking integrations [IT-03], and embedded accessibility practices verified with assistive       ┃
┃     technologies [A11Y-01]. We partnered with city privacy officers to implement minimization and retention aligned to local ordinances [PRIV-01], and we delivered outcome-centered       ┃
┃     dashboards in Power BI that helped traffic operations reduce response times and improve public communication [IT-02]. These repeatable patterns—secure hosting, standards-based        ┃
┃     integration, accessible design, and decision-ready analytics—will be applied from day one in Springfield.                                                                              ┃
┃  11 Pricing Approach and Assumptions Our pricing balances predictability with flexibility. We propose fixed-price deliverables for discovery, platform setup, and Phase 1 launch, paired   ┃
┃     with time-and-materials for integrations where partner complexity varies. This structure protects the City’s budget while enabling predictable delivery under FAR Part 12 [C-01].      ┃
┃     Assumptions include City-provided Microsoft licensing coverage for Azure Government hosting and Microsoft 365/Power BI to avoid duplicative platform costs [IT-01, IT-02]. As scope    ┃
┃     clarifies during Task 1 [T-01], we will refine unit costs for additional integrations using the established OpenAPI pattern [IT-03].                                                   ┃
┃  12 Compliance Cross-Reference Summary The solution aligns to Springfield’s compliance expectations: FAR Part 12 commercial-item acquisition [C-01]; Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 AA           ┃
┃     accessibility for all public experiences [A11Y-01]; NIST SP 800-53 Moderate controls for security and operations [SEC-01]; multi-factor authentication for privileged and staff access ┃
┃     [SEC-02]; a two-hour incident reporting standard to the City’s CISO and DoIT security leadership [SEC-03]; Azure Government and FedRAMP Moderate hosting [IT-01]; Microsoft 365 and    ┃
┃     Power BI for collaboration and analytics [IT-02]; and REST/JSON APIs governed by OpenAPI specifications [IT-03]. Tasks [T-01..T-04] and dates [D-01..D-05] are embedded throughout the ┃
┃     plan to maintain traceability from requirement to delivery.                                                                                                                            ┃
┃  13 Conclusion and Next Steps This plan aligns to the City’s compliance matrix and schedule and keeps the focus on what matters to residents: simpler permit processes, clearer curb       ┃
┃     information, and faster response when conditions change. The phased approach delivers early wins by December 31, 2025 [D-04], and governance with rigorous testing mitigates risk      ┃
┃     through Final Acceptance on August 31, 2026 [D-05]. As a practical next step, we recommend a short pre-award session to confirm scope boundaries, partner onboarding priorities, and   ┃
┃     data governance decisions so the Kickoff on September 2, 2025 [D-03] begins with a refined backlog, clear KPIs, and a shared understanding of how we will measure resident impact.     ┃
