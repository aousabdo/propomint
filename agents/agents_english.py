    "Call out opportunities to embed compliance references and metrics naturally inside sentences rather than as detached lists, and delete any bracketed requirement tags in favor of plain-language citations (e.g., \"per the RFP on page 3\").",
    "Flag any remaining bracketed identifiers (e.g., [IT-1]) or robotic phrasing so they can be rewritten before submission.",
